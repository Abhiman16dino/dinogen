# Welcome to Dinogen!

Hi! this project came out just because I was bored and for a long time I was thinking how can we make a **VS Code** extension. After going through some blogs and tuts things were becoming quite clear and I thought why not use the power of **GenAI** and make something cool out of it.


# How to use?

Simply install the plugin highlight any piece of text right click on it or press CMD+SHFT+P and select dinogen. It will directly print the output to the editor below the highlighted text and also show warning levels in an information dialog.

## Tech Involved

Dinogen uses google's **PALM Api** to generate the responses.
